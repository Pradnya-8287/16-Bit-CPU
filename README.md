# 16-Bit-CPU
This is a custom 16-bit CPU, designed and simulated in Logisim Evolution (v.3.8.0).
The project brings together the core elements of a processor, registers, ALU, memory, control logic, and I/O, into a working 16-bit architecture.

It’s meant as a hands on exploration of computer architecture: writing instructions, executing them in hardware, and watching how the CPU processes data step by step. Along with the circuit, the repo includes assembly examples, opcode files, and a Python script to help generate machine code.
